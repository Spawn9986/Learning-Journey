Day 1 (April 10, 2023)

I will start fresh today on being consistent and start from scratch in my learning.
I will map out my learning based on Javascript and FE, BE, databases, deployment, etc

Start with HTML and CSS. HTML is for content whereas CSS is for styling. CSS can be 
embedded within the HTML page or loaded using a tag.

HTML element conists of an opening and closing tag i.e., <p></p>. HTML can have unique
identifyers that dont show in the content and go by attribute and values.

Anything in HTML between <!-- and --> is an HTML comment.

### ----- Questions ---- ####
How do I embed CSS styling into an HTML element as opposed to importing a CSS file?
Why do some elements written differently (void elements) such as img tags etc?
